On Tuesday, 26 May, Kevin Hassett, President Trump's Economic Advisor, claimed that "our human capital stock is ready to get back to work", which has sparked controversy across Twitter, among economists and non-economists alike. Some economists have simply claimed that [it isn't an issue](https://twitter.com/MichaelRStrain/status/1265429375643762690). Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [has claimed](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1265308665080426497) that it is the same as referring to workers as "human stock".

Discussing the benefits and drawbacks of a term like *human capital*, and exploring the history of the term are certainly valuable, but these discussions miss the heart of the controversy. 

Every response to Hassett's statement, including Chris's [article](https://www.chrisdanko.com/blog/2020/05/of-human-capital/), has missed or at least failed to articulate the main cause of this controversy: Hassett used the term "human capital stock" in a way that makes no sense, and is not aligned with any accepted definition of the term.

*Human capital* is capital which a person can possess, which can be obtained through education, training, experience, etc.

As defined by [*Encyclop√¶dia Britannica*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-capital), human capital is:

"...intangible collective resources possessed by individuals and groups within a given population. These resources include all the knowledge, talents, skills, abilities, experience, intelligence, training, judgment, and wisdom possessed individually and collectively, the cumulative total of which represents a form of wealth available to nations and organizations to accomplish their goals."

The term *human capital*, then, really is quite incontroversial, but those who insist that there is no controversy over Hasset's statement are ignoring that he misused the term -- a person's human capital is a measure of their skill, education, training, ability, etc. A nation's "human capital stock" is a form of wealth which the workers own, and it is not the workers themselves. Defined this way, human capital stock cannot want "to get back to work." Let us rephrase Hassett's sentence to illustrate just how ridiculous it sounds: "the intangible collective resources possessed by Americans are ready to get back to work." 

Clearly, this is not at all what Hassett meant -- it is much more likely that he mistakenly referred to the labor force as the human capital stock. This is still a problem of course, and, coming from an economist in a powerful public position, it is certainly not a mistake to ignore. However, we need to be clear about the issue and to understand why so many of us found the statement insulting.

In summary: there is nothing wrong with the term *human capital* as it is generally used. The issue is that Hassett refered to workers as "human capital stock", which, using any definition of the term, does not make sense.
